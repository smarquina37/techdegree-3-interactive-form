# techdegree-3-interactive-form
This is a registration form used with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked with JavaScript to add focus and blur elements to fields, display/hide certain fields, add validation forms so users are inputting their informaton correctly, and displaying error messages when users are trying to submit incorrect form inputs. This will make it easier for the user to select the correct shirt colors and know exactly what they need to correct if they are not able to submit their form and get error messages.

I enjoyed working on this project and it helped me to continue practicing my coding skills. I do see that my code is not as DRY as I think it could be, but I tried unsuccessfully to go back to my form validation and make the code more concise. I will keep the DRY concept in mind when writing code in the future and will try to get better at going back to code that has already been written and shorten code wherever I can. This time around, I was not able to successfuly do it and have the function/event listener work as it did with the longer code.
